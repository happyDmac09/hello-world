# hello-world
First repository
My name is Dominic and I want to learn how to code/program. Eventually, I would like to program artificial intelligence and help develop what they can do for two reasons. The first is to further explore the unexplored with the help of bots like these, and the second is to understand the way they work so we can prevent, combat and control any potential malfunctions and/or attacks by AI.
